                <p>
                   I have a background in Mechanical engineering, as well ass hazardous materials, assembly and deconstruction. My higher education is in Anthropology and now coding, with a high school degree. In my last/current job I work as the lab supervisor of a Calibration lab at Tech Master Electronics.

                    Currently at Tech Master Electronics I supervise the calibration lab for for all techs working in silicon Valley, as well as go to on-sites meet with customers and a number of other positions. I have worked here for 2 years growing and expanding my position with in the company exponentially. As important as this job has been in learning skills and adapting to harsh environments it has mostly prepared me for a future in tech and where my life will end up. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future I plan to take my coding career further and find jobs involving the work I would like to do later in life. At some point I plan to work on a project that involves astro-science or one that would involve work on a lunar station. Although I can't predict the future being involved in some kind of space exploration is my dream and I can't imagine my life without it.
